# DutchCulturalHeritageVocab
A vocabulary for Dutch Cultural Heritage

Introduction
------------

The goal of this project is to create a Linked Data vocabulary that can be used to describe data about Dutch cultural heritage entities. The vocabulary should provide definitions of national concepts, to be used in any data set. It should also link national definitions to international definitions, where possible.
